    <h3>Mojito - Your Beach Vacation In A Glass</h3>

    <div class="first-paragraph">
        <p>
        The Mojito is a rum based cocktail that is sweet, tangy and refreshing. Served chilled, it can refresh the thirstiest of days faster than any other beverage probably can.
        Mojitos are ideally made with mint, fresh lime juice, sugar, seltzer and (of course) rum. Served in a tall glass, with a whole lof of ice, they are a staple at nearly all watering holes in warmer climes.

Just a tall glass (that you will also use to drink them in), a bar spoon and a bar measure is all you need to create this cocktail!</em></strong>
