    <h3>The Cosmopolitan - Classy As Cocktails Come!</h3>

    <div class="first-paragraph">
        <p>
        The Cosmopolitan, or cosmo, is a sweet-citrus drink that is served chilled in a martini glass and has the capability to lift up your spirits as soon as you start sipping it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="second-paragraph">
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Also called "Cosmo", this is a vodka based cocktail that's best consumed in the evenings, out from a cocktail glass.</span> And at bars where you have enough elbow room to not have it spilled!</em></strong>
        </p>
    </div>  

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Vodka (traditionally, a lemon vodka is used, but a normal vodka will work just as well) - 45ml</li>
        <li>Triple-sec - 15ml</li>
        <li>Cranberry juice - 60ml</li>
        <li>Lime juice - 10ml</li>
        <li>Ice-cubes - 2 or 3</li>
        <li>Orange zest - small peel</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol class="method">
        <li>Put all the ingredients except the orange zest into the shaker.</li>
        <li>Shake well, and pour it through a strainer into the martini glass.</li>
        <li>To finish the drink, take the orange zest, squeeze the oils onto a lit flame on top, and slide the spent zest into the drink.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <span class="sign-off">And as easy as that, you have your Cosmopolitan ready to drink!</span>
